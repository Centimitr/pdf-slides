# Context 

You can also explain the unique concept of a diary and how it would relate to farming activities that is supposed to be done in the case study. 

You are missing the integration requirements with other data providers and also the ability of the platform to support multiple user interface technologies. 

Also the portal helps in knowledge sharing to improve the production process more than controlling the same.

 # Challenges

You are missing references to justify your argument even though all of the points you have mentioned are valid.

As an example you have mentioned handling data import and integration challenge due to multi platform support. 

If you can substantiate this with a research study that discusses the challenges in projects that deal with multiple plaforms (there are quite a few studies done in this area), it should act as a verified and reliable source of research that backs up your argument. 

You can think of these justifications as applicable to all other challenges that you have identified. 

# Risks

Observers also need to register in the portal but yes the data can be collected from all the registered users. 

This is valid.Technical lead and planning activities happen once the project has started and that is the purpose of project managers and software engineering practioners like us to help them. 

How would you justify the risk of running out of budget ? 

This is a valid risk but how would you explain as related to the current case study ?

Think of this aspect from a higher level as well.

As an example what will happen if good network connectivity and internet is not present in rural areas where most of the farming happens ? 

It is a risk for the success of FarmX. Also how can too many features be a risk in terms of budget and time ? 

# SDLC Evaluation

The client here is Wilma and Barnaby and the platform for farmers is being built by them. 

What would you mean by telling the project has a flexible scope ? 

You have mentioned scrum and extreme programming as applicable options but how will you explain these models as applied to our case study ? 

As an example what feature of scrum model would suit the development of farmx project. 

This link is missing between the model characteristics and the project requirements 

# SDLC Selection - 

You have not evaluated Incremental model in the previous step but you have selected it for the project. 

Without evaluating the pros and cons of the model how would you justify the applicability of the model to our project ?

How different is creating features such as Diary entries different from integration with other sources of data (for which you have mentioned that scrum is not applicable and extreme programming can help). 

Infact if you review the model characteristics,fixing issues can be handled by sprint cycles really well. 

In addition it is never a standard practice to use two or more SDLC methodologies in one single project. 

We evaluate multiple techniques and then decide on a best model to suit the requirements of the project. 

We would not be doing a scenario wherein waterfall, incremental and agile are all used for different phases of the same project.
